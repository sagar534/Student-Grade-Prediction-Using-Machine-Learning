Student Grade Prediction using Machine Learning
This machine learning project aims to predict students’ final math grades (G3) using demographic, academic, and lifestyle features. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes information such as previous grades, study time, alcohol consumption, parental education, and more.

🧠 Problem Statement
Accurately predicting a student’s academic performance can help in identifying students who may need additional support or intervention. In this project, we build a regression model to forecast students' final math grades based on various factors, with the goal of understanding what most influences student success.

📦 Dataset
Source: UCI Student Performance Dataset
File used: student-mat.csv
Target variable: G3 (Final grade in Math)
Input features: 30+ attributes including demographics, grades (G1, G2), study habits, support received, and absences.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Language: Python 3.11

Libraries:

pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
scikit-learn – Machine learning (model training, evaluation, preprocessing)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of final grades (G3)

Relationships between study time, alcohol use, and performance
Correlation heatmaps to identify strong predictors
Feature importance visualization using trained model

🧪 Feature Engineering
To enhance prediction accuracy, new features were created:

avg_grade: average of G1 and G2
grade_improved: whether the student improved from G1 to G3
total_alcohol: combined weekday and weekend alcohol use
parent_edu_avg: mean parental education level
engagement_score: score representing involvement and focus
has_support: binary flag indicating support received (school/family/private)
⚙️ Model Development
Model Used: RandomForestRegressor
Why Random Forest? It's robust, handles both linear and nonlinear relationships, and ranks feature importance.
Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
Mean Absolute Error: ~1.25  
R² Score: ~0.92 (highly accurate)
🔍 Key Insights
G1 and G2 (previous grades) are the strongest predictors of final grade
Alcohol consumption and absences negatively correlate with performance
Students with academic support perform slightly better
Study time and family background also show a moderate effect
