ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict studentsâ€™ final math grades (G3) based on various academic, 
demographic, and behavioral factors. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains attributes like previous grades, 
study habits, family background, and more.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Accurately predicting a student's performance can enable early intervention and personalized support. 
This project builds a regression model to forecast students' final math grades and identify key predictors of academic success.
